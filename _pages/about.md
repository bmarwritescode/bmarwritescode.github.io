I am the Vice President of Research and Development at [Veridise](https://veridise.com), where we aim to harden blockchain security with formal methods. Additionally, I am a computer science PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin working with [IÅŸil Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/). My goal is to develop automated techniques that help developers create safe code. In pursuit of this goal, my research uses a combination of program synthesis, program analysis, formal verification, and machine learning.

Before joining UT Austin, I got my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the University of Maryland at College Park, where I worked as a research assistant under [Jeff Foster](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/). I have also had the pleasure of working as a research scientist in the Machine Programming Lab at Intel with [Justin Gottschlich](https://sites.google.com/view/gottschlich) and as a research intern with [Maria Christakis](https://mariachris.github.io/) at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS).
